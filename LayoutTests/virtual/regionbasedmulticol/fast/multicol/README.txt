# This suite runs the tests in LayoutTests/fast/multicol/ with --enable-region-based-columns.
# Note that a bunch of tests may be skipped in TestExpectations, because we don't
# have a baseline corresponding to the region based multicol implementation yet.
#
# See the virtual_test_suites() method in Tools/Scripts/webkitpy/layout_tests/port/base.py.
