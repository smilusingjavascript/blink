Description

This test validates that the performance.mark() method is working properly. This test creates the following marks to test this method:

"mark1": created using a normal mark() call
"mark1": duplicate of the first mark, used to confirm names can be re-used
After creating each mark, the existence of these marks is validated by calling performance.getEntriesByName() (both with and without the entryType parameter provided), performance.getEntriesByType(), and performance.getEntries()

PASS window.performance is defined 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[0].name == "mark1" 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[0].startTime ~==  (up to 20ms difference allowed) 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[0].entryType == "mark" 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[0].duration == 0 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[1].name == "mark1" 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[1].startTime ~==  (up to 20ms difference allowed) 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[1].entryType == "mark" 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")[1].duration == 0 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1", "mark") returns an object containing the "mark1" mark in the correct order 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1", "mark") returns an object containing the duplicate "mark1" mark in the correct order 
PASS The "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1", "mark") matches the the "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1") 
PASS The duplicate "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1", "mark") matches the the duplicate "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1") 
PASS window.performance.getEntries() returns an object containing the original "mark1" mark in the correct order 
PASS window.performance.getEntries() returns an object containing the duplicate "mark1" mark in the correct order 
PASS The "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntries() matches the the "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1") 
PASS The "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntries() matches the the duplicate "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1") 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByType("mark") returns an object containing the original "mark1" mark in the correct order 
PASS window.performance.getEntriesByType("mark") returns an object containing the duplicate "mark1" mark in the correct order 
PASS The "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByType("mark") matches the the "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1") 
PASS The "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByType("mark") matches the the duplicate "mark1" mark returned by window.performance.getEntriesByName("mark1")
