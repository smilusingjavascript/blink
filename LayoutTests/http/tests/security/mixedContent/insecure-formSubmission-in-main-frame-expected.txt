CONSOLE WARNING: line 2: The page at 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-formSubmission.html' was loaded over HTTPS, but is submitting data to an insecure location at 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/security/resources/boring.html': this content should also be submitted over HTTPS.

This test opens a window that shows a form with "action" pointing to an insecure location. We should trigger a mixed content callback because the main frame in the window is HTTPS but is posting to insecure location.
