CONSOLE WARNING: The page at 'https://127.0.0.1:8443/security/mixedContent/resources/frame-with-insecure-plugin.html' was loaded over HTTPS, but ran insecure content from 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/security/mixedContent/resources/dummy.swf': this content should also be loaded over HTTPS.

This test loads a secure iframe that loads an insecure plugin. We should get a mixed content callback because the insecure plug-in can script the secure origin.
