Unknown script types should not be loaded nor executed. If this test fails, an extra line will appear in the output with the script's MIME type.
Note: In the current Blink implementation, HTMLPreloadScanner may fetch srcs even though they are invalid. The current HTMLPreloadScanner does not check if the script tag has valid type/language attribute. See crbug.com/329531 for the current status.
